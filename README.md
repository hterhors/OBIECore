# OBIECore
The Core Source Code of the Ontology Based Information Extraction Framwork

**NOTE** This project is still under heavy development!

**Dependencies**
There are **no** dependent projects. However, this project is necessary in all OBIE-related projects!

**Related Projects, Implementations / Examples**
1) OWL2JavaBin https://github.com/hterhors/OWL2JavaBin is a tool that can be used to convert ontologies written in OWL into java binaries which are used in the OBIE-ML-Framework.
2) SoccerPlayerOntology https://github.com/hterhors/SoccerPlayerOntology is an example ontology that was generated with OWL2javaBin. It contains the OWL file and the resulting java binaries. 
3) SoccerPlayerOBIEProject https://github.com/hterhors/SoccerPlayerOBIEProject is a project that works with the generated SoccerPalyerOntology. It contains example source code for
  i) the information extraction task using the OBIE MachineLearningFramework (incl. template / feature generation), 
  ii) how to convert an OWL to java binaries. 
  It further, contains an examplary annotated data set that was automatically generated from Wikipedia/dbpedia data using the DBPediaDatasetExtraction project.
4) OBIEMachineLearning https://github.com/hterhors/OBIEMachineLearningFramework is a project that contains the main source code for the ontology based information extraction.
